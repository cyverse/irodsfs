- iRODS Host: `data.cyverse.org`
- iRODS Port: `1247` (Default, omitted) 
- Zone: `iplant`
- Collection: `/home/iychoi`
- Mount Path: `/mount/irods`

```shell script
./bin/irodsfs irods://iychoi@data.cyverse.org/iplant/home/iychoi /mount/irods
```

After mounting, `irodsfs` will be executed in the background. To unmount, use `umount` command.

```shell script
sudo umount -f /mount/irods
```

## Mount iRODS Collections with PAM Authentication (with SSL)

A configuration file describing the conneciton information in YAML format `./examples/ssl_config.yaml` must be provided with `-config` argument in the command line.

- User: `iychoi`
- iRODS Host: `data.cyverse.org`
- iRODS Port: `1247` (Default, omitted) 
- Zone: `iplant`
- Collection: `/home/iychoi`
- Mount Path: `/mount/irods`
- Authentication Scheme: `pam`
- CA Cert File: `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

- Encryption Algorithm: `AES-256-CBC`
- Encryption Salt Size: `8`
- Hash Rounds: `16`

```shell script
./bin/irodsfs -config ./examples/ssl_config.yml irods:///iplant/home/iychoi /mount/irods
```

- User: `iychoi`
- iRODS Host: `data.cyverse.org`
- iRODS Port: `1247` (Default, omitted) 
- Zone: `iplant`
- Path Mapping YAML File: `./examples/multi_collection_mapping.yaml`
- Mount Path: `/mount/irods`

```shell script
./irodsfs -u iychoi -host data.cyverse.org -zone iplant -mapping ../examples/multi_collection_mapping.yaml /mount/irods
